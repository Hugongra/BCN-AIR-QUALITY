PART 1: STATEMENT
One of the main concerns of the citizens of Barcelona is the pollution in the city. 
Barcelona has a number of sensors distributed throughout the city. These sensors are constantly (hour by hour) measuring the quality of the air.
You can find the information about these sensors and its locations in the following link: https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/qualitat-aire-estacions-bcn :
* You can download the file (Qualitat_Aire_Detall.csv) by clicking on “download", and you will obtain a .csv file, which you can load as a text (base) file in R Studio.
* By clicking on "View complementary description and field definition" you will get further information
The measurements that the sensors are doing can be found here: https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/qualitat-aire-detall-bcn. As you can see we have a different file for each month. We want to analyze all the information of 2022 together. Make sure you understand the data provided. Analyze the data and refer to the documentation available on the website.
Note that several contamination / polluting factors are being analyzed. More info here: https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/contaminants-estacions-mesura-qualitat-aire
There is something else we want to consider. For each of the sensors deployed, we also want to find out if there is any relationship between the pollution levels detected in the neighborhood (area) they are located and the number of trees in that neighborhood (area). Are the trees helping to keep the neighborhood cleaner? Help us find out! We need three things to complete this analysis:
1. The trees in green areas, you can find this information here https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/arbrat-parcs (you may be familiar with this data)
2. Also the trees on the streets, which you can find here: https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/arbrat-viari
3. Finally, the size of the neighborhood (area) matters because density is a critical factor here. You can find the surface of each area here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Barcelona. You can also find the population per neighborhood in this link
We need to provide a report, as complete as possible, combining all these data sources. Try to provide answers to these questions, but also provide any other analysis you consider meaningful and relevant.
1. How are the pollution indexes evolving during the year? Is there any particular peak in any month, day, or hour of the day that you consider concerning?
2. Which is the impact of the "green level" (density of trees) on these indicators? Are the trees helping keep the air clean at all?
3. Which neighborhoods are more polluted and which are less polluted? Which is the amount of population involved in the best (and worst) neighborhoods?
An extensive and comprehensive report of your analysis is expected. Create it using R Markdown using the strategy we discussed in the communication class:
* Combine code, explanations and plots
* Make appealing plots. Use all the strategies you have seen to make them good plots (aesthetics, labels, titles, subtitles, etc)
General remarks:
* When you open a CSV file in R Studio, always remember to change the coding to UTF-8 (to avoid problems with accents and special characters) and select "Yes" in Heading (to use the first line of the CSV as the name for each variable):
  

* There is a high amount of information to process. Make sure you align with your team mates and find efficient ways to distribute the workload and then combine results. If you have questions ask your teacher.
* Make sure you use the right combinations of techniques you have seen in class. You will probably need to use ways to merge and transform your data. Validate the results you get after every step.
* Work on this project STARTING TODAY. Don't leave it for the last week or you will not have time to deliver a proper exercise.
PART 2: DELIVERABLES AND CONDITIONS
* The files indicated cannot be modified in any way and must be loaded in R as-is. All calculations and data manipulation that you need to do must be performed in R.
* Do this project in groups of 4 people. If you have any issues with this let Ignasi know. Send your groups by email.
* Two deliverables are expected: a pdf report created with R Markdown and all the R code used properly structured and commented.
* Contact Ignasi as soon as you need him. He's here to help.
* General questions about the project or the data must be posted in the public forum.
* Timings:
   * Wednesday 21st: last day to share with Ignasi the members of your group
   * Wednesday 25th: final day to deliver the project.
* Zoom or in-person interviews will happen after delivery of the project. Students may pass or fail the activity individually (meaning that depending on the outcomes of the interview the teacher may decide that not all students deserve the same grade).
